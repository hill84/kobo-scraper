<h1>Kobo scraper</h1>

**Kobo scraper** is a Node.js service that uses puppeteer to scrape books data from <a href="https://kobo.com">kobo.com</a>.

Run `npm install`. When finished, type `npm start` to run the scraping. You should see a new `books_[#].json` file for every page in the `/json` folder.
